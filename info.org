TODO
 1. integrate the python logic into a Godot project
 2. create an interactive pizza graph to schedule events!
    · how it's done? do we separate year and day? or do we start 1° with the year, then after setting it we increase the precision by showing the graph with day? considering that each percent of a year has ~ 3 days!
 3. would suggest an abstraction to turn a standard date into clock's abstraction! it could be about running the script with arguments... how it's implemented into app's UI?

guess we can delete './clock prototype.py'?

maybe we can turn this into the "self" application?

for setting the timezone in Arch Linux,
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager#Automatically_set_the_timezone

for setting "Action Buttons" title,
xfconf-query -c xfce4-panel -p /plugins/plugin-10/custom-title -s "   $(/bin/python /home/luqtas/Desktop/projects/clock/clock.py)   "
which offers an advantage of also offering a dual function (sleep, shutdown etc.)
